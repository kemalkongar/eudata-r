Analysis of Eurobarometer data using R

This repository is for the storage of our POLI 311 Group Project for the Winter 2019 term at McGill University.

The aim was to analyse the impact of "Europeanness" on support for a common secrutiy and defence policy throughout the Union. While the analysis was part of the project, the repository will only include the R Markdown file, the PDF output and the data source file.
